	<h1>DEMOCRACY</h1> 

	<p>
        Democracy is that form of governance where the elected representatives from the public make the government.
        Voting is the right that each adult individual has to elect the representative for the government.
        So voting for a representative to govern is the way the public participates in the governance of the state.
        In a democracy where everyone has a say in the matters of policy making it is only possible to elect a few representatives who express the opinions on behalf of the public.
        The importance of voting in a democracy lies in the idea behind the form of governance.
        The voting process decides under which government your entire nation will work.
        And if somebody has faith in a candidate, he should definitely vote for him because voting is critical. Results are a different factor, but every person should vote. Sometimes a vote can decide the future of a nation and that could be the instance when you might be cursing yourself for not voting, that is why voting is essential
